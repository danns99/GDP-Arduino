Include required libraries
Define aerodynamic and control values for 3 system states
Define flight envelope limits for safety checks

SETUP SEQUENCE	
	Initialize serial communication and specify baud rate
	Create and configure a new file on the SD card
	Configure pins:
		4 pins for ADA254 SD Card module
		1 pin for MAX485 TTL to RS485, along with TX and RX TTL pins (?)
		1 analogue input pin for MPX5010DP sensor
		SCL and SDA pin for MPU6050 sensor
		4 analogue input pins for thermistors
		4 digital output pins for LEDs on control panel
		1 pin for button on control panel
		1 pin for safety relay
	Initialise interrupts, and define at what frequency the interrupt occurs
	Define starting system mode as 'OFF'
	Initialise sensors and check communication has been established with Arduino
	Initialise actuators and clutches

INTERRUPT SEQUENCE (~1kHz)
	if STATE = OFF then
		Update flight speeds, pitch and pitch rate from sensors
		end
	if STATE =! OFF then
		Update flight speeds, pitch and pitch rate from sensors
		Run safety check function
		if safety check function returns unsafe then
			Set system to OFF state
			Trigger an alert to warn pilots that system has been disabled
			Record to SD card that system was disabled
			end
		else
			Run control calculations using aerodynamic and control values for whichever state the system is in
			Send updated position requirement to actuator
			end
		end

LOOP SEQUENCE (~10Hz)
	Check if system state has changed
	Display the current system state using the LEDs
	Record flight speeds, pitch and pitch rate to SD card
	delay
