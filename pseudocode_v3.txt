INITIALISATION SEQUENCE

Initialise all Arduino modules
Run control loop initialisation function

INTERRUPT SEQUENCE  (~1kHz)

	if STATE = OFF then
		Run flight data update function
	if STATE =! OFF then
		Run flight data update function
		Run safety check function
		if safety check function returns unsafe then
			Set system to OFF state
			Light all LED's to inform pilots that system has been disabled
			Record to SD card that system was disabled
		else
			Light dead mans switch LED to indicate depression of dead mans switches
			Run control function
			Send updated position requirement to actuator

LOOP SEQUENCE (~10Hz)

	Run status check function
	if status = OFF
		Light the 'OFF' LED
	if status = 1
		Light the '1' LED
	if status = 2
		Light the '2' LED
	if status = 3
		Light the '3' LED
	Write current flight and control data to SD card
	delay

FUNCTIONS

Func: Flight Data Update
	Func: Update airspeed:
		 Read MPX5004DP sensor value using analogRead()
		 Calibrate sensor reading, using pre-defined sensor offset value
		 Convert result to voltage reading
		 Using equations from datasheet, convert voltage into differential pressure reading
		 Convert differential pressure reading into airspeed using rearranged Bernoulli equation
	Func: Update pitch and pitch angle:
		 Read x, y and z accelerations from MPU6050 sensor
		 Use trigonometry to calculate pitch angle
		 Read pitch rate from MPU6050 sensor

Func: Status Check
	if position of rotary switch has changed
		Change system mode to new position of rotary switch

Func: Safety Check
		Check g loading not exceeded
		Check flight speed not exceeded
		Check aircraft angle of attack not exceeded
		Check elevator deflection not exceeded
		Check that dead mans switches are still pressed
		if all of the conditions are true
			return TRUE
		else
			return FALSE
